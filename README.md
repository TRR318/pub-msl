Implementation of the MSL experiments as submitted to XAI conference.

We include the script that runs the [experiments](experiments/main_experiment.py) and the [notebook](experiments/plots_clean.ipynb) that generates the figures in the paper.
All experiments must be run from the root folder of the project, otherwise the configured paths have to be modified.
We also provide the [football dataset](data/player.csv) introduced in the paper.
